# Java Based Website (Vanilla, No Frameworks)

## Description

This was a semester long project in web applications development. It features a ground up, full stack application complete with
a connected MySQL database, multi-page routed front end, JSP web API's, and styling. All handled using Netbeans and the Java Glassfish server.
This demonstrates a baseline of my web applications knowledge, as most of my modern implementations use popular frameworks.

Use case for this site was to satisfy course requirements and serve as a temporary personal site, although the design of this site was quickly eclipsed by more robust libraries used to build mycurrent site.

## Installation

| Dependency | Description |
| :--------: | ----------- |
| Netbeans | This IDE was chosen because it integrates all necesarry Java utilities with a glassfish server quite seemlessly. Not required but certainly very helpful given the tech stack. |
| Java | The core of the site functionality. |
| MySQL | Previously, a server was running my MySQL DB but since conclusion of the course, it has been shut down. |
| GlassFish | Web server used during development. Could likely be replaced with something more robust like Apache or Nginx. |

## Usage

Using Netbeans, site can be easily launched from the native GUI.
